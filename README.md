PHPT Snippet for Sublime
====================

Simple snippet to bootstrap PHPT files

##Install

To install through [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), search for PHPT Snippet. If you still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, [go get it](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).

If you prefer to install it manually, you can download the package and put it inside your `Packages` directory. It should work but will not update automatically.

##Usage

Enter PHPT and press tab in your phpt file.
